## ‚ú® introduction
- We introduce **Multi-Attribute Chinese Calligraphy Character Dataset (MCCD)**, an isolated Chinese character dataset with rich annotations including character, script style, dynasty, and calligrapher.
- **Extensive Multi-Attribute Collection:** MCCD dataset presents a meticulously curated collection of nearly 330,000 calligraphic character images, ensuring a comprehensive diversity of annotation categories for all characters and their attributes (style, dynasty, and calligrapher).
- **Multi-Attribute Subset Construction:** MCCD contains labels for 7,765 categories of characters, in addition to which three additional subsets are extracted from the dataset according to the attribute annotations for each character, including 10 styles of calligraphy, 15 major historical dynasties and 142 famous calligraphers, with the aim of optimizing task-specific utilization of the attribute information.
- **Benchmark Establishment:** We established benchmark performance metrics for single-task recognition (character and each attribute independently) and multi-task recognition (character combined with other attributes simultaneously) experiments using MCCD and all its subsets.
